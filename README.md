# AWS Mbed OS SDK port library

This library provides the port of the AWS IoT SDK for Mbed OS. It can be used to connect devices running Mbed OS to the AWS IoT Core service over MQTT.

An example demonstrating the use of this library has been provided as part of the official Mbed OS examples [here](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-aws.git).

## Summary:

1. This library depends on:
   1. AWS IoT device embedded-C SDK available [here](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C).
   1. tinycbor library available [here](https://github.com/intel/tinycbor.git\#755f9ef932f9830a63a712fd2ac971d838b131f1).
1. This SDK port follows the steps listed in AWS' developer guide found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/c-sdk/main/guide_developer.html).
1. The "Config header" and the "Platform Types" requirements can be found in the library under [`mbed/include/`](./mbed/include)
1. The "Platform layer" port can be found under [`mbed/src/`](./mbed/src) . As a minimum, a system clock, mutex, semaphore, network implementation and an optional thread implementation are required. More details on this are provided [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/c-sdk/platform/index.html#platform). The thread implementation is optional and needed for synchronization between threads while using traces for debug messages.
